You can also know that how many attendees are attending your survey lively and how many are not. Every group has a team that helps you to secure your data which means that the data is only shared within your team. Quiz facility is also available that helps you to conduct online examinations and quizzes easily and it doesn't matter where you are. You can also know who has given what answer and in quizzes the same facility is given and you can also add points for each question and the total points will be calculated by surveyzilla.
